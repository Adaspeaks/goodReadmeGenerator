# goodReadmeGenerator

## Description
By using inquirer to merge HTML whithin JS files we are able to generate a readme via prompts fed to the user. This will also have a fully functional table of contents and allow them to choose between a few licenses for their project with interactable License badges.

## Table of Contents
* [Installing the dependencies](#Installation)
* [Usage instructions!](#Usage)
* [Contact Info](#Contact)

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. To learn more visit:

## Installation

All necessary dependencies can be installed by using

```
npm i
```

into the console.

## Usage
To run the program simply run

```
node index.js
```

in your prefered terminal begin interfacing with the inquirer prompts which will ask you to define things such as the title, a description of the application, how to install the dependencies, how one can use the application, how to run any pre desinged tests, contribution guidlines, which license you'd like your project to fall under, and finally your github username and email.
